# Isometric Illustration Prompts

These prompts are designed to generate isometric illustrations that follow Brotea's brand guidelines: built on an isometric grid, primarily gray tones with a single bright accent color (either purple or lime green), addressing specific topics that photography cannot cover.

## Technology & Digital Concepts
